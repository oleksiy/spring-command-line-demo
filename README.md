# To Start
- create an app.groovy scriping with a Controller that returns a string from one of the methods annotated with @RequestMapping("/endpoint") annotations
- `spring run app.groovy` will resolve all dependencies and publish the application on localhost
- curl localhost:8080/your_endpoint or just /, and you'll see the message
- Done!
